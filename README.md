I created the Currency class and its 5 derived class with getter functions.
A simple userface is also created in main().
I put the main() inside Currency.cpp because I want to test-run the code as I'm coding and I'm not done with Currency.h yet. (I'm quite confused on how to use header file)

I did the overloaded operator for '+' and '-'  in each derived class (not yet used doe, because Wallet functions not created yet)
I also did the overloaded input and output operator 

Did NOT do YET list:
1. Finish header class for Currency.
2. Seperate main() from Currency.cpp.
3. Wallet class and its functions (Storing Money)
